# Predicting Survey Responses with Machine Learning  
### Using BES Data to Evaluate the Viability of Shortening Surveys

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Context

High-quality survey data is crucial for informing public policy and academic research. However, response rates and participant retention have declined significantly post-COVID, prompting interest in ways to **shorten surveys without compromising data quality**.

This project investigates whether **survey item H1** â€” respondentsâ€™ prioritisation of the environment versus the economy â€” can be predicted using other items from the same survey. If prediction accuracy is high, this question may be a candidate for removal in future iterations, reducing survey fatigue without losing analytical value.
